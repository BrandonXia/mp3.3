When loading GDT and IDT:
	Behavior: sometimes it keeps rebooting, sometimes it terminates accidentally.
	Problem: not using the gdt_desc_ptr correctly.
	Solved by: edited the gdt_desc_ptr. Though it was still rebooting, but it turned out that it was rtc that was causing rebooting.
	
When setting up IDT:
	Behavior: always can't return the correct description of the exception.
	Problem: not entering intel reserved exceptions.
	Solved by: adding them.

When setting up i8259
	Behavior: itr connected to the slave pic cannot be received
	Problem: when enabling pins on the slave pic, the second pin on the master pic is not inicialized.
	Solved by: enable 2nd pin on master slave whenever the slave pic is enabled.

When running in kernel.c
	Behavior: cannot receive any interrupts.

irq_rtc not modified:
we forget to modify irq_rtc to 0x28(which is 0x20 + 8), so  we can't receive  our interrupt.
time taken: 20 min

alogrithm for get frequency is wrong:
I set the times that rtc_interrupt need to run equal to the frequency, while it should be the frequency of RTC / the frequency set. (flash more frequntly as frequency I set increase, instead of less).
time taken: 15 min

When testing the vertical scrolling
	Behavior: The kernel crashed
	Problem: Segmentation fault
